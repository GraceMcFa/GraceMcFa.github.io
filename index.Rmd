## [BIOL3100 final project](./Final_Project/Germination-Treatment-Analysis)

What to say about myself??? I am graduating May 1st with a BS in Botany. My life goal is to own my own winery and to travel the world. 

I chose Botany as my Major because I fell in love with it as a kid tagging along with my grandpa who was a Botany professor at UC Irvine. 

I have been working on an independent research project with Dr. Michael Rotter for the last three years, and I am trying to publish a paper right now. 

 I love the outdoors, hiking, camping, rock climbing, snowboarding, wakeboarding, reading, crocheting, spending time with family and friends, and taking naps.
